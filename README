Filer is a JavaScript library for large file uploads using the HTML5 file APIs.


REQUIREMENTS

The Pwnalytics JS has been tested and works against the following browsers:
* Chromium / Google Chrome 11.0+
* Firefox 4.0+

Patches for extending compatibility are always welcome.


USAGE

test/index.html contains an example of usage, and src/filer/_first.js contains
the spec for the PwnFiler constructor. A nice tutorial will be added here when I
find the time.


BUILDING

Filer's build process is driven by a Rakefile, and its dependencies are managed
by Gemfile, so you need the following:
* rubygems
* rake, bundler -- gem install rake bundler

The other dependencies can be installed from bundler:

    bundle install

Kick off the build process from rake:

    rake build

The build outputs the following files:
* bin/filer.js is a development version of the filer, used in test/index.html
* bin/filer.min.js is minified and contains the sjcl dependency code
* bin/filer-worker.js has a development version of the Web Worker startup stub
* bin/filer-worker.min.js must be deployed in the same dir as filer.min.js

Filer depends on sjcl, and includes a slimmed down version of it. If you want to
update the embedded sjcl code, delete vendor/sjcl.min.js and kick off the build
process.


TESTING

I couldn't figure out how to automate the uploading UI, so the testing is
manual, and uses a local Sinatra server.

Launch the test server:

    rake server

Then point your server to the test URL and test away.

     http://localhost:9393

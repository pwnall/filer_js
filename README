Filer is a JavaScript library for large file uploads using the HTML5 file APIs.


REQUIREMENTS

The Pwnalytics JS has been tested and works against the following browsers:
* Chromium / Google Chrome 11.0+
* Firefox 4.0+

Patches for extending compatibility are always welcome.


USAGE


todo


BUILDING

Filer's build process is driven by a Rakefile, and its dependencies are managed
by Gemfile, so you need the following:
* rubygems
* rake, bundler -- gem install rake bundler

The other dependencies can be installed from bundler:

    bundle install

Kick off the build process from rake:

    rake build

The build outputs a development version in bin/filer.js and a minified version
intended for production in bin/filer.min.js


TESTING

I couldn't figure out how to automate the uploading UI, so the testing is
manual, and uses a local Sinatra server.

Launch the test server:

    rake server

Then point your server to the test URL and test away.

     http://localhost:9393
